# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple console-based implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
## Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers such as GCC or Clang.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each cell on the grid is represented by a number from 1 to 9
2. Two players take turns to make their moves. Player 1 uses 'X' as their marker, and Player 2 uses 'O'.
3. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the desired cell.
4. The game will validate your move and display the updated grid after each turn.
5. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Customization
You can modify the source code to add additional features or customize the game. Feel free to experiment and make changes according to your preferences.
